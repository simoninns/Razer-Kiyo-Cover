# Razer Kiyo Cover
## Overview
This project provides a 3D printable privacy cover for the Razer Kiyo webcam.  It is designed to be easy and fast to print as well as work in the majority of camera configurations.

The cover features a flip-down design with a friction lock to keep the cover in place even if the camera is tilted downwards to the maximum extent. It is also held onto the camera with a friction grip meaning that no glue or sticking tape is required.  The cover also flips back far enough that it stays open even if the camera is tilted to the maximum extent.

The inner surface of the top clip is also contoured to allow the outer ring to rotate freely even with the cover in place (the back of the clip holds the top clear of the ring).  This allows you to freely adjust the ring light brightness without removing the cover.

Note that, due to the back clip, it is not possible to use the cover if the camera stand is completely folded back (i.e. used from a vertical tripod mount screw).

The front of the cover provides a small hole for the activity LED allowing you to see if the camera is active even if the cover is closed.

## Printing instructions
The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x20 printing bed.

### Recommended print settings

* Material: PETG
* Layer: 0.20mm (Quality)
* Infill: 15%
* Supports: No Supports
* Print time (approximate): 1h 20m

## Assembly
The hinge mechanism for the cover is 'print-in-place' so no assembly is necessary.  Be careful of the hinge when removing the print from the print-bed so as not to snap or bend the hinge.
